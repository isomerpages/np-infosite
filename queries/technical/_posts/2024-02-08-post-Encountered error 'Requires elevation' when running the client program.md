<p>The "setup.exe" client program needs to be run as an administrator to
work properly. Temporarily disable the anti-virus software installed on
your notebook to prevent any unexpected errors during installation.</p>
<p></p>

<p>After downloading the <a href="https://swd.np.edu.sg/Softwares/ClientSetup/setup.exe" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">setup.exe</a> client
program, right-click and select <strong>Run as administrator. </strong>Do
note that you have to perform this step even if you are already logged
on as an administrator on your notebook.</p>
