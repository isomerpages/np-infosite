<p>Upon successful installation, the “Install” button will be grayed out
to “Installed” status as shown below. You will not able to click again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, at times the button may still show “Install” after the software
has installed successfully. If this happens, try quitting the setup.exe
file and launch it again as an administrator. If you have checked that
the software has installed successfully and able to run properly, you may <strong><u>IGNORE</u></strong> the
“Install” button status.</p>
