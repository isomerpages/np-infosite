<p>If you have changed course after enrolment, there is a possiblity that
the client program is still showing your previous course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please email your new course along with your name, student ID to <a href="mailto:itcare@connect.np.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">itcare@connect.np.edu.sg</a> for
the change to be made. Log in after 1-3 business days to check if your
new course is reflected correctly.</p>
