<p>Welcome to the Software Portal, a dedicated platform for Ngee Ann Polytechnic
students. Our aim is to assist you in finding the right software for your
specific year of study and course.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Software Licensing</h2>
<p>We provide licensed software to NP students throughout their course of
study, free of charge. Each student can register and install software on <strong>one notebook only</strong>.
By downloading the software, you accept that any attempts to duplicate,
transfer, install or use the software on notebooks other than your own
constitute a violation of NP’s software licensing terms and conditions.</p>
<h2>Notebook Requirements</h2>
<p>Whether you choose to purchase a notebook from our authorised suppliers
or your preferred supplier, please ensure that it's the correct type of
notebook and that it meets the minimum specifications for your course.
You can select your course on the Software Download page to view these
the notebook specifications. If you have an old notebook and are unsure
if it can be used for your course, you can use the same method to check.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>

technical queries, please write to <a href="mailto:itcare@connect.np.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">itcare@connect.np.edu.sg</a>.&nbsp;Include
