<p>Welcome to the Software Portal, a dedicated platform for Ngee Ann Polytechnic
students. Our aim is to assist you in finding the right software for your
specific year of study and course.</p>
<h2>Software Selection and Installation</h2>
<p>We provide licensed software to Ngee Ann’s students throughout their course
of study, free of charge. Each student can register and install software
on <strong>one notebook only</strong>. You are strongly encouraged to equip
your notebook with the relevant software for your course before the semester
begins in April to avoid long wait times.</p>
<h2>Notebook Requirements</h2>
<p>Whether you choose to purchase a notebook from our authorised suppliers
or your preferred supplier, please ensure that the notebook meets the minimum
specifications for your course. You can select your course on the Software
Download page to view these specifications. If you have an old notebook
and are unsure if it can be used for your course, you can use the same
method to check.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>If you encounter any difficulties with software installation, please write
to <a href="mailto:Dora.ITcare@np.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">itcare@connect.np.edu.sg</a>.
Include your name, course, and student ID in your email.</p>
<h2>NPNet Password</h2>
<p>The NPNet password mentioned on the software guides refers to the Course
Registration password on the Acceptance of Offer letter.</p>
<h2>Student Number and Password</h2>
<p>Your student number and password for notebook registration can be found
in your Acceptance of Offer letter. To view your Acceptance of Offer letter,
download the mStudent App and tap on “Get Started”.</p>

<p>We hope this portal serves as a valuable resource for your academic journey
at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Happy studying!</p>
