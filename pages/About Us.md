<p>Welcome to the Software Portal, a dedicated platform for NP students.
Our aim is to assist you in finding the right type of notebook and software
for your specific year of study and course.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Software Licensing</h3>
<p>We provide licensed software to NP students throughout their course of
study, free of charge. Each student can register and install software on <strong><u>one</u> </strong>notebook
only. By downloading the software, you accept that any attempts to duplicate,
transfer, install or use the software on notebooks other than your own
constitutes a violation of NP’s software licensing terms and conditions.</p>
<h3>Notebook Requirements</h3>
<p>Whether you choose to purchase a notebook from our authorised suppliers
or your preferred supplier, please ensure that it's the correct type of
notebook and that it meets the minimum specifications for your course.</p>
<h3>Technical Support</h3>
<p>If you encounter any difficulties with software installation or have any
technical queries, please write to <a href="mailto:itcare@connect.np.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">itcare@connect.np.edu.sg</a>.&nbsp;Include
your name, course, student ID and screenshots of the error message in your
email.</p>
<h3>NPNet Account and Password</h3>
