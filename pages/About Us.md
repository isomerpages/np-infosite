<h3>Empowering learning with digital services and technology</h3>
<p>At Ngee Ann, Information Technology plays a crucial role in enhancing
our studentsâ€™ educational experience. Through our Wireless infrastructure
and Mobile Computing initiative, both staff and students can seamlessly
access online resources, participate in eLearning, engage in discussions,
and complete assignments from anywhere. Enrolling in elective modules is
also conveniently done online. Additionally, the NPal Student and Staff
Self-Service websites, along with Payment Kiosks, further enhance the accessibility
and timeliness of information and services across the campus.</p>
