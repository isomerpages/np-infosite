<br>Bachelor of Arts (Education), National Institute of Education, (NTU) Nanyang
Technological University
<br>
<br><strong>Profile/Areas of Interest :</strong>
<br>Prior to joining NP, Eunice once taught English, and quite unconventionally,
Mathematics in a secondary school. She also enjoyed a short stint at Singapore
Polytechnic as an Adjunct Lecturer, where she taught modules related to
communication and critical thinking. Eunice finds interacting with youths
meaningful and is grateful to have the opportunity to guide and journey
with them as an educator. She hopes to impart young people with knowledge
that goes beyond academics so that they, in turn, will contribute to the
community.
<br>
<br>Outside of teaching, Eunice derives joy in baking, playing board games
(especially ones to do with words) with friends and exploring different
corners of Singapore and the world with her little family.</p>
