<br><strong>Profile/Areas of Interest :</strong>
<br>Kok Sing has been teaching with Ngee Ann Polytechnic since 2009, when
he ended his 13-year affair with advertising. It was a passionate relationship
that produced numerous off-springs - advertisements and campaigns into
which he put his heart and soul. As a copywriter, he found the romance
with words both exhilarating and a truly unending learning journey. Stops
on the journey include J. Walter Thompson, TBWA and the Ad Planet Group.
Some of the brands he worked with include Chivas Regal, Nivea, LG, DBS
Bank, Standard Chartered and StarHub.</p>
<p>Kok Sing loves languages. Besides being bilingual in English and Chinese,
he speaks Japanese and a smattering of Thai. He hopes to pick up a European
language someday.</p>
<p>Kok Sing believes that compassion is the most important value in life
and nothing lifts the spirit like a kind word.</p>
