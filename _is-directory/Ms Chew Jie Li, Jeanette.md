<br><strong>Profile/Areas of Interest:</strong> 
<br>Jeanette agrees with the saying, "it's a beautiful thing when a career
and a passion come together", and is thankful that this is the case for
her. As an educator for nearly 15 years, she has had many opportunities
to share her interests, particularly in the social sciences and innovation,
with her students. Outside work, she enjoys getting lost in a good book.</p>
