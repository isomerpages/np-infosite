<p><strong>Profile/Areas of Interest :<br></strong>Prior to joining Ngee
Ann, Yu Ching enjoyed an exciting stint in the public service, where her
job was to share Singapore's governance story with the world. She has organized
study visits and hosted government dignitaries from China, Japan, Korea,
Russia, Uzbekistan and even Namibia.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>She returned to her first love and pursued a Master's degree in History,
where she wrote a thesis about the rousing student political scene in 1950s
Singapore. At the same time, she tutored undergraduate modules in Singapore
history and is a facilitator with The Thought Collective.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through these experiences, Yu Ching found her passion in people development
work. She is guided by the belief that teaching does not happen when the
teacher is ready to teach, but when the student is ready to learn. Therefore,
she endeavours to make her lessons as relevant and engaging as possible.Yu
Ching also plays the keyboard in a metal band and has a weakness for desserts.â€‹</p>
