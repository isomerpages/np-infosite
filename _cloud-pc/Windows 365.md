<h4>As part of the pilot phase, access to Cloud PC is limited to selected staff only.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloud PC (CPC) offers a revolutionary way to access your desktop and NP
Intranet services from any devices with an internet connection. With this
solution, you will enjoy increased flexibility and convenience of accessing
your work remotely. CPC allows access to Outlook email, MS Teams, NPal
Campus Solutions (CS), Staffhome Intranet, Workday, SharePoint Online and
OneDrive storage.</p>
<p>During your first launch of CPC, baseline apps such as MS Office apps,
Google Chrome, Adobe Acrobat, Azure Information Protection, etc will be
installing in the background. Please disconnect from CPC to allow all software,
updates and polices to complete installing in the background. Reconnect
to CPC the following day to access your Outlook email and NP Intranet services.&nbsp;</p>
