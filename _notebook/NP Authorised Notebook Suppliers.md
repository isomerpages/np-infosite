<h4>Why should I purchase my notebook from the authorised suppliers?</h4>
<p>The Polytechnic has identified several approved suppliers who will sell
notebook computers on the campus at reasonable prices. You are strongly
encouraged to buy your notebook from these suppliers because you will enjoy
3 key advantages:
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Advantage #1 : Collective Consumer Protection <br></strong>The
Polytechnic may be able to help arbitrate any genuine complaint that could
arise during the 3 years of warranty.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Advantage #2 : Notebooks with 3-Year On-Site Warranty <br></strong>The
Notebooks come with a 3-Year Warranty, inclusive of all parts (including
AC adapter and cord) and labour cost (except for the battery which normally
comes with 1-Year Warranty) on-site at your residence or on-campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Advantage #3 : Next-Business Day Service <br></strong>Our authorized
suppliers provide after-sales services on a Next-Business Day basis on-site
at your residence or on-campus.</p>
<h4><br>How many notebooks am I allowed to purchase from the authorised suppliers?</h4>
<p>Each student is only allowed to purchase ONE notebook regardless of the
authorised supplier. It is necessary to show your Student Card or Acceptance
of Offer letter when you place your order and take delivery of your notebook.</p>
