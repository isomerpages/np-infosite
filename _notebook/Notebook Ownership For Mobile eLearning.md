<blockquote>
<p>You must use own personal notebook computer and other IT device(s) for
learning and assessment at NP, as required by your Diploma course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the vision for mobile e-learning, Ngee Ann Polytechnic introduced
the own-a-notebook computer scheme for its students in July 1999 to ensure
that every student is equipped to participate in and benefit from the Polytechnic's
Mobile eLearning (MeL) environment. This environment prepares you for work
and life in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>Your notebook computer will be an integral part of your learning experience
at Ngee Ann as it will enable you to engage in IT-enabled learning activities
and digital learning environments, both in-class and outside of scheduled
class times. This gives you the 'anytime, anywhere' flexibility to work
on assignments, surf the internet for information, access module websites,
participate in online activities, communicate with your tutors, interact
and collaborate with your classmates &amp; project members, create digital
content, and much more.</p>
<p>Depending on the course you are enrolling into, you will need to own either
a Windows-based notebook computer or a Mac-based Apple notebook computer.</p>
