<h4>Why do I need a notebook?</h4>
<p>NP's objective is to enhance the learning process of our students and
to add-value to their education. Specifically, the use of the Notebook
for learning enables our students to become self-directed learners and
IT savvy professionals.</p>
<p>These are important skills and traits for your continued success in increasingly
mobile, connected, and IT-infused work and learning environments. Your
Notebook experience will prepare you for this.</p>
<h4>What can I use the notebook for?</h4>
<p>Your notebook will enable you to engage in IT-enabled learning and digital
learning environments, both in-class and outside of scheduled class times.
This will give you the 'anytime, anywhere' flexibility to work on assignments,
surf the internet for information, access module websites, participate
in online discussion, communicate with your tutors, interact and collaborate
with your classmates and project members, create digital content, and much
more.</p>
<h4>Where in campus can I use the Notebook?</h4>
