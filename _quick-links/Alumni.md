NPal Student, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc. remember to <strong>download and save them </strong>to
your personal notebook or portable hard disk <strong>prior to the migration date.</strong>
</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>From</u> the migration date onwards, </strong>you
may login to your Alumni account (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>xxx@alumni.np.edu.sg</u></a>)
and register for <a href="http://aka.ms/ssprsetup" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="loopstyle_link"><u>self-service password reset</u></a> by
