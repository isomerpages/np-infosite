<p><strong>Profile/Areas of Interest :</strong>
<br>Noor teaches Global Cities, Ethical Dilemmas and CQ@ Work. Her interest
to develop her full potential in teaching and learning drove her to pursue
a career at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Noor was schooled in Perth, Western Australia
where she completed her undergraduate and graduate studies.</p>
<p>Having spent more than a decade pursuing an education in laid-back and
sunny Perth, Noor returned to Singapore with much reluctance but since
then has developed a renewed sense of belonging to the city-state. Noor
is committed to making Singapore a place where everyone can feel truly
belonged. She contributes to this process&nbsp;&nbsp;by being involved
in advocating social justice issues particularly concerning the rights
and welfare of migrant workers in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She has presented at numerous conferences on labour migration issues in
Singapore and has contributed to academic publications and policy reports
on the subject.&nbsp;She hopes to impart in her students a strong sense
of social justice and a belief in the force of the individual as an agent
of change.</p>
